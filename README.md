# C-ROM-Linker
This is a C Linker wrapper that essentially takes a relocatable combined object file of a C project and injects all global/file static variables and functions from the object file into the ROM file! You can compile and link your C project directly into a game ROM! This is currently only supporting the ARM7TDMI architecture.
